<p align="center">This is a fully responsive e-commerce website.This project should demonstrate my ability to use responsive design, css flexbox, css grid and media queries. In this project I decided to use flexbox and grid instead of bootstrap 4 (used in the previous projects) to gain deep understanding of these amazing and neccessary tools for the web development. This project should also demonstrate my ability to use HTML, CSS and photoshop. </p>
